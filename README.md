- 👋 Hi, I’m Miguel Sandler-Espinosa!
- 👀 I’m interested in Interactive Web Design, but I am at a turning point and am excited to begin learning new things, especially ML and NLP.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Algorithms and SQL at UMass Amherst.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web stuff! Especially cool design stuff, I like doing funky stuff with Three.js, if you've got a cool project idea I'd love to be a part of it.
