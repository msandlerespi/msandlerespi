ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Miguel Sandler-Espinosa! I am a highly interdisciplinary computer scientist and musician interested in exploring how music, technology, and environment can interface and interact. Technology has, in recent years, been making it more difficult for people to connect with one another in real life; in the long term, I hope to create a piece of technology that helps to remedy that.
